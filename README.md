### My interest
In my spare time, I play aound with techs that interest me such as configuring PXE boot server, docker container and compose, virtualization, media server and tailscale.

Since I'm a beginner in playing guitar I'm interested in building a simple ML model that can check playing posture in real time; I've got this idea from learning OpenCV last semester in autonomous robotic class using ROS.

My interest in CS mostly in the automation part since I like to make my life easier.
